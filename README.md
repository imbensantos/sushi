# Project Title: 📛
Sushiman

# Live Link / Demo Link: 🔗


# About the Project: 📚
Sushiman is a basic, modern, and responsive website with animations!

# Technologies Used: ☕️ 🐍 ⚛️
I used HTML and CSS to create the site, AOS library for the animation, and Vite for the local server.

# Setup / Installation: 💻
- Download or clone the repository
- Run npm install
- Run npm run dev
- Click on the local server or http://localhost:5173/

# Approach: 🚶
I maintained a well-organized file and folder structure and embrace the principles of writing clean code. As such, I used CSS variables to handle the colors and fonts as well as adopted the BEM naming style for my CSS classes.
