# Sushiman
Sushiman is a basic, modern, and responsive website with animations!

I used `HTML` and `CSS` to create the site, `AOS` library for the animation, and `Vite` for the local server.

# Approach: ðŸš¶
In order to embrace the principles of writing clean code, I split the CSS into different files and imported them, used CSS variables to consistently handle colors and fonts, as well as adopted the BEM naming style for my CSS classes. I also used flex and position properties for a responsive design and was able to create smooth and subtle animations using the Animate On Scroll library. Throughout the project, I also maintained a well-organized file and folder structure.
